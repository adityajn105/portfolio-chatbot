"""A real MCP server for contacting the site owner, built with FastMCP.

The second MCP server in this project (the first is blog_server.py). It runs as
its OWN process and exposes a single tool, `send_message`, that forwards a
visitor's message to Aditya by email via his portfolio's Formspree endpoint.
The agent connects over stdio and calls it exactly like `search_site` — same
protocol, different capability. No index, no model: this server is tiny.

The actual send lives in contact.send_contact_message (stdlib only), shared with
the in-process client so both transports behave identically.

Run standalone (stdio):  python mcp_server/contact_server.py
The agent normally launches this for you (see agent.build_agent).
