"""The `send_message` capability — forward a visitor's message to the site owner
by email, via the portfolio's existing **Formspree** endpoint.

Kept in its own stdlib-only module (like `rag.search_site_text` for search) so
both transports return byte-identical results: the real FastMCP contact server
(mcp_server/contact_server.py) and the in-process contact client
(mcp_client.InProcessContactMCPClient) import this one function. No third-party
deps — a contact form shouldn't pull in the whole RAG stack.

Formspree emails the owner whatever we POST; its free tier is ~50 messages/mo,
so the guardrails here (real-looking email + non-empty message required) matter:
the agent must only reach for this when a visitor genuinely wants to get in touch.
